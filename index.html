          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Let me start by introducing myself as an "Epistemophile" - meaning that I have this strong desire to attain knoledge; it is more like an obsession. I love knowing the latest developments in "Science, Medicine, Agriculture and Technology" most especially. One of my hobbies is jotting down solutions to world problems whenever I come across any. What drives me and keeps me going is knowing the fact that there are a lot of problems in the world and there would definitely be a time where I would use all the knowledge I have acquired throughout my years  to solve as many problems in the world as possible. I am also an introvert who owns a farm and is constantly experimenting on the latest trends in Agriculture. I have recently turned a section of my farm into a Hydroponics farm - this is the latest project I am working on; I want to know the number of local Nigerian crops that can be grown using water instead of soil. Also, I am from Nigeria and I have only a mum and a brother.

          <h2>Educational Background</h2>
          <p>
            I graduated from Cardoso Catholic Secondary School in the year 2020. Due to my always neat appearance, I was always one of those who were chosen to represent my school in outings. It was through these school outings I was able to know about the "Sustainable Development Goals" and what thier aim was to changing the world and making it a better place. That experience was the birth of the passion I have in me  now to provide as many solutions as I can  to many world problems. I am a medical science student who has a deep love for Agriculture and I have just been given admission to study Science Laboratory Technology in Yaba College Of Technology. I have used the years after my Secondary School gradution to equip myself with as much tech skills as possible. I didn't let my not being admitted into a university deter my passion, rather I saw it as a growth period and utilised it. Through my constant search for knowledge, I was able to come across Power Learn Project (PLP) Africa scholarship and I am currently learning about Software Development.

          <h2>Professional Interests</h2>
          <p>
            The existence of technology has never ceased to amaze me. The myriad of opportunities it offers are uncountable.  Not to talk of the fact that technology is actually reshaping the world. These are all what makes "tech"  exciting to me and with the opportunity I have gotten to be a part of the Power Learn Project Academy;I have gained an interest in Front End Development,  I want to know more about and have a proffessional career from it. In the nearest future I plan on implementing tech into medicine and agriculture by being well versed in other aspects of tech programs.
